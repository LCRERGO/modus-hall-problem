# Modus Hall Solution
---------------------
This repository has been made to agregate a solution for the first task of
Operational Systems class in the second semester of 2020.

### Exposition
This problem is a way of solving in what manner is it possible to make two
entities of people, in this case mods and reshalls to pass from one side of a
path to the other, without conflicting with one another.

### Requirements
- make
- A C compiler(gcc, clang, tcc...)

### How to Build
To build simply run make on the directory. e.g.:
```shell
$ make
```
By default it uses gcc as the compiler to use another compiler such as clang,
set the CC variable before compiling, as stated in:
```shell
$ CC=clang make
```
